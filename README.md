# nowplaying
Meteor app that shows the latests tweets nearby the location of the visitor, including a youtube video and #nowplaying hashtag.

I've been wanting to try [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for a while and this seems a perfect chance to do it. I think Meteor works fine because it's focused on writing isomorphic js apps.

Also used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as a base for styling forms and other elements.
